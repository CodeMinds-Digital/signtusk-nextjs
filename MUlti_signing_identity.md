✅ Multi-Identity Support Fixed
🔧 Problem Solved
The homepage was showing either/or options based on local wallet presence, but users need access to all identity management options regardless of their current state.

💡 New Button Layout
The homepage now always shows:

"Create New Identity" (Primary button) - Always visible
"Login to Local Identity" (Secondary button) - Only when local wallet exists
"Import Existing Identity" (Secondary button) - Always visible
🎯 Complete User Scenarios Supported
Scenario 1: First-time user (no local wallet)
Buttons shown:

✅ "Create New Identity" → /signup
✅ "Import Existing Identity" → /import
Scenario 2: User with local wallet
Buttons shown:

✅ "Create New Identity" → /signup (create additional identity)
✅ "Login to Local Identity" → /login (access current local wallet)
✅ "Import Existing Identity" → /import (import from another device)
Scenario 3: Power user with multiple identities
Can easily:

✅ Switch between identities by importing different ones
✅ Create additional identities for different purposes
✅ Access local identity with password
✅ Import identities from other devices
