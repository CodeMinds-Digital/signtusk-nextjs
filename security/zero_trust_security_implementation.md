## Introduction to Zero Trust

Zero Trust is a security framework that operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify." Unlike traditional security models that focus on perimeter defense, Zero Trust assumes breach and verifies each request as though it originates from an untrusted network.

Key aspects of Zero Trust:
- Verify explicitly - authenticate and authorize based on all available data points
- Use least privilege access - limit access to only what's necessary
- Assume breach - operate as if a breach has already occurred

In the context of SignTusk, implementing Zero Trust principles means enhancing client-side security to protect sensitive wallet data at all times, regardless of where it's stored or accessed.

## Current Security Implementation

The current SignTusk implementation includes several security measures:

- **Password-based encryption** of wallet data using CryptoJS
- **Challenge-response authentication** using wallet signatures
- **Mnemonic phrase verification** during login
- **HttpOnly cookies** for JWT tokens
- **Secure random nonce generation** for challenges
- **Expiring challenges** to prevent replay attacks
- **Identity consistency checks** to verify wallet integrity

While these measures provide a good foundation, they can be enhanced to better align with Zero Trust principles.

## Zero Trust Security Principles

For our client-side implementation, we focus on these key Zero Trust principles:

1. **Verify Explicitly**: 
   - Authenticate and authorize based on all available data points
   - Implement continuous validation rather than one-time authentication
   - Use multiple factors and contextual information for authentication

2. **Use Least Privilege Access**:
   - Limit access to only what's necessary
   - Implement just-in-time and just-enough-access policies
   - Minimize the attack surface by restricting unnecessary access

3. **Assume Breach**:
   - Operate as if a breach has already occurred
   - Implement segmentation to limit lateral movement
   - Use encryption to protect data at rest and in transit
   - Implement detection and response capabilities

4. **Data-Centric Security**:
   - Focus on protecting the data itself, not just the perimeter
   - Implement end-to-end encryption for sensitive data
   - Use data obfuscation techniques like steganography

5. **Device Security**:
   - Verify device health and compliance before granting access
   - Implement device fingerprinting and attestation
   - Use secure enclaves or trusted execution environments where possible

6. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Implement real-time monitoring and analytics
   - Use behavioral analytics to detect anomalies
   - Log and audit all access attempts

7. **Defense in Depth**:
   - Layer security controls to protect against different attack vectors
   - Combine multiple security techniques for stronger protection
   - Implement redundant security measures

## Enhanced Security Measures

### End-to-End Encryption

The enhanced encryption implementation uses the Web Crypto API to provide stronger cryptographic operations than the current CryptoJS implementation.

**Key Improvements:**

1. **Stronger Key Derivation**
   - Increased PBKDF2 iterations from 10,000 to 310,000
   - Using SHA-256 for the hash function in PBKDF2

2. **Authenticated Encryption**
   - Using AES-GCM instead of AES-CBC
   - Provides both confidentiality and integrity protection
   - Authentication tag ensures ciphertext hasn't been tampered with

3. **Web Crypto API Benefits**
   - Hardware-accelerated cryptographic operations
   - Non-extractable keys for better security
   - Secure random number generation
   - Standardized implementation across browsers

4. **Implementation Details**
   - Encryption of wallet data before it leaves the client
   - Separate encryption of mnemonic and private key
   - Version information for backward compatibility

### Client-Side Steganography

Steganography adds an additional layer of security by hiding the very existence of sensitive data within innocuous carrier files (images).

**Key Features:**

1. **Data Hiding**
   - Uses steg-js library for LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography
   - Hides encrypted wallet data within images
   - Makes it difficult for attackers to even know what to target

2. **Carrier Image Options**
   - Users can provide their own carrier images
   - Default carrier images are provided as a fallback
   - Image validation ensures steganography will work properly

3. **Random Padding**
   - Adds random padding to prevent statistical analysis
   - Makes steganalysis more difficult
   - Padding length is derived from a secure random seed

4. **Secure Storage**
   - Stego images stored in IndexedDB for larger data capacity
   - Stego keys stored separately from images for security
   - Minimal reference data stored in localStorage

### Combined Approach

The combined approach integrates both enhanced encryption and steganography to create a multi-layered security solution.

**Key Aspects:**

1. **Defense in Depth**
   - Multiple layers of security protection
   - Even if one layer is compromised, others remain intact
   - Attackers need to break both steganography and encryption

2. **Key Management**
   - Different keys for different security layers
   - Encryption key derived from password using strong key derivation
   - Steganography key stored separately from wallet data

3. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Steganography layer hides the existence of sensitive data
   - Encryption layer protects the confidentiality of the data
   - Each layer has a specific security function

4. **Fallback Mechanisms**
   - Graceful degradation if advanced security features fail
   - Users can still access wallets with standard security
   - Backward compatibility maintained

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Encryption Implementation

```typescript
// Key derivation parameters
const PBKDF2_ITERATIONS = 310000; // Increased from 10000
const KEY_LENGTH = 256; // bits
const SALT_LENGTH = 32; // bytes

// Encryption parameters
const IV_LENGTH = 12; // bytes (for GCM mode)
const AUTH_TAG_LENGTH = 16; // bytes
const ALGORITHM = 'AES-GCM'; // Using GCM mode for authenticated encryption
```

The enhanced encryption process:
1. Generate a random salt
2. Derive a key from the password and salt using PBKDF2
3. Encrypt the data using AES-GCM with the derived key
4. Store the encrypted data, IV, salt, and authentication tag

### Steganography Implementation

```typescript
// Hide wallet in image
const { stegoImage, stegoKey } = await hideWalletInImage(encryptedWallet, carrierImageFile);

// Store stego image in IndexedDB
await storeImageInIndexedDB(normalizedAddress, stegoImage);

// Store stego key in localStorage
const stegoKeys = getStegoKeys();
stegoKeys[normalizedAddress] = stegoKey;
localStorage.setItem(STEGO_KEYS_STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(stegoKeys));
```

The steganography process:
1. Load a carrier image (user-provided or default)
2. Generate a random stegoKey
3. Add random padding to the data to prevent statistical analysis
4. Hide the data in the image using LSB steganography
5. Store the resulting stego image in IndexedDB
6. Store the stegoKey separately in localStorage

### Combined Security Implementation

```typescript
// Step 1: Generate a secure random encryption key derived from password
const salt = generateRandomSalt();
const encryptionKey = await deriveEncryptionKey(password, salt);

// Step 2: Encrypt the wallet data
const encryptedMnemonic = await encryptData(walletData.mnemonic, encryptionKey);
const encryptedPrivateKey = await encryptData(walletData.privateKey, encryptionKey);

// Step 3: Combine encrypted data into a single object
const encryptedWalletData = {
  encryptedMnemonic,
  encryptedPrivateKey,
  address: walletData.address,
  customId: walletData.customId,
  version: 'v3-combined'
};

// Step 4: Convert to JSON string
const encryptedDataString = JSON.stringify(encryptedWalletData);

// Step 5: Hide encrypted data in image using steganography
const { stegoImage, stegoKey } = await hideWalletInImage(
  encryptedDataString,
  carrierImageFile
);
```

The combined security process:
1. Generate a secure random encryption key derived from the password
2. Encrypt the wallet data using enhanced encryption
3. Combine the encrypted data into a single object
4. Convert the object to a JSON string
5. Hide the encrypted data in an image using steganography
6. Store the stego image, stego key, and minimal reference data separately
