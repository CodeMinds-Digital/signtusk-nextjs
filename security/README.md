# SignTusk Zero Trust Security

This directory contains documentation and implementation guides for the Zero Trust security model implemented in SignTusk.

## Overview

SignTusk has implemented a comprehensive Zero Trust security model for client-side authentication and wallet data protection. This implementation includes enhanced encryption, steganography, and a combined approach that provides multiple layers of security.

## Documentation

- [Zero Trust Security Implementation](./zero_trust_security_implementation.md) - Comprehensive documentation of the Zero Trust security principles and implementation details.
- [Zero Trust Implementation Guide](./zero_trust_implementation_guide.md) - Technical guide for developers implementing the security measures.

## Key Security Features

### Enhanced Encryption

- Uses Web Crypto API for hardware-accelerated cryptographic operations
- Implements AES-GCM for authenticated encryption
- Uses PBKDF2 with 310,000 iterations for key derivation
- Provides backward compatibility with existing encrypted data

### Client-Side Steganography

- Hides encrypted wallet data within innocuous carrier images
- Uses LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography via steg-js
- Adds random padding to prevent statistical analysis
- Stores stego images in IndexedDB for larger data capacity

### Combined Approach

- Integrates both enhanced encryption and steganography
- Implements multiple layers of security (defense in depth)
- Uses different keys for different security layers
- Provides fallback mechanisms for graceful degradation

## Security Levels

Users can choose from three security levels:

1. **Standard** - Basic password-based encryption (legacy)
2. **Enhanced** - Strong end-to-end encryption with Web Crypto API
3. **Maximum** - Combined encryption and steganography protection

## Implementation

The implementation follows these principles:

- **Data-centric security** - Protecting the data itself, not just the perimeter
- **Defense in depth** - Multiple layers of security protection
- **Least privilege** - Limiting access to only what's necessary
- **Continuous verification** - Verifying at each step of the process
- **Assume breach** - Operating as if a breach has already occurred

## Getting Started

For developers looking to implement these security measures:

1. Review the [Zero Trust Security Implementation](./zero_trust_security_implementation.md) document to understand the principles and overall approach.
2. Follow the [Zero Trust Implementation Guide](./zero_trust_implementation_guide.md) for detailed technical instructions.
3. Implement the security measures in a phased approach, starting with enhanced encryption, then adding steganography, and finally the combined approach.

## Security Considerations

- The combined approach provides the highest level of security but requires more processing time and resources.
- Enhanced encryption offers a good balance between security and performance for most use cases.
- All implementations include fallback mechanisms to ensure users don't lose access to their wallets.
- Regular security audits and penetration testing are recommended to ensure the effectiveness of these measures.
