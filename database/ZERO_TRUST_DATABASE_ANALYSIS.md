# Zero Trust Database Schema Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the database schema changes required to support the Zero Trust security implementation in SignTusk. The analysis is based on the security documentation in the `/security` folder and the current database schema in `complete_schema_fixed.sql`.

## Zero Trust Security Levels

The implementation supports three security levels:

1. **Standard (v1)** - Legacy password-based encryption using CryptoJS
2. **Enhanced (v2)** - Strong end-to-end encryption using Web Crypto API with AES-GCM
3. **Maximum (v3)** - Combined encryption and steganography protection

## Required Database Changes

### 1. Wallets Table Modifications

**New Columns Added:**
- `encryption_version VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'v1'` - Tracks encryption method used
- `enhanced_encryption_data JSONB` - Stores EncryptionResult objects for enhanced/combined modes
- `steganography_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT false` - Indicates if steganography is used
- `steganography_metadata JSONB` - Non-sensitive metadata about steganography usage
- `security_level VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'standard'` - Overall security level

**Rationale:**
- Supports backward compatibility with existing v1 encrypted wallets
- Enables storage of enhanced encryption data (separate IV, salt, authTag for each encrypted field)
- Tracks steganography usage for audit purposes (actual stego data stored client-side)
- Provides clear security level classification

### 2. Auth Sessions Table Enhancements

**New Columns Added:**
- `security_level VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'standard'` - Security level used in session
- `encryption_version_used VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'v1'` - Encryption version for session
- `device_fingerprint VARCHAR(255)` - Device identification for continuous verification
- `security_context JSONB` - Additional security context data

**Rationale:**
- Enables tracking of security context per session
- Supports continuous verification principles of Zero Trust
- Allows monitoring of security level usage patterns

### 3. New Security Tables

#### Security Events Table
Tracks all security-related events for Zero Trust monitoring:
- Security level upgrades/downgrades
- Encryption version changes
- Steganography enable/disable events
- Suspicious activities
- Device changes
- Risk scoring (0-100)

#### Device Security Context Table
Manages device trust and continuous verification:
- Device fingerprinting
- Trust scores (0-100)
- Security capabilities tracking
- Failed attempt monitoring
- Trusted device management

#### Security Metrics Table
Daily aggregated metrics for Zero Trust analytics:
- User distribution across security levels
- Steganography adoption rates
- Security upgrade trends
- Risk event frequencies

## Storage Architecture for Zero Trust

### Client-Side Storage (No Database Changes)
- **IndexedDB**: Stores steganography images (large binary data)
- **localStorage**: Stores steganography keys and minimal reference data
- **Memory**: Temporary encryption keys and decrypted data

### Database Storage (Schema Changes Required)
- **Enhanced Encryption**: JSON-formatted EncryptionResult objects
- **Security Metadata**: Version tracking, security levels, audit trails
- **Device Context**: Trust scores, fingerprints, verification history
- **Audit Data**: Security events, risk assessments, compliance tracking

## Key Functions Added

### Security Management Functions
1. `upgrade_wallet_security()` - Handles security level upgrades with audit logging
2. `log_security_event()` - Records security events for monitoring
3. `update_device_security_context()` - Manages device trust scores
4. `get_security_statistics()` - Provides security analytics
5. `cleanup_security_data()` - Maintains data hygiene

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing v1 wallets continue to work unchanged
- Migration path: v1 → v2 → v3 with user consent
- Graceful fallback if advanced security features fail
- Version-aware encryption/decryption handling

## Security Benefits

### Zero Trust Principles Implemented
1. **Verify Explicitly**: Device fingerprinting, continuous verification, risk scoring
2. **Least Privilege**: Security level-based access, minimal data exposure
3. **Assume Breach**: Defense in depth, multiple encryption layers, audit trails

### Enhanced Security Features
1. **Authenticated Encryption**: AES-GCM with integrity protection
2. **Strong Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with 310,000 iterations
3. **Data Hiding**: Steganography for additional obfuscation
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security event tracking
5. **Risk Assessment**: Automated risk scoring and threat detection

## Implementation Considerations

### Performance Impact
- Enhanced encryption: Moderate CPU overhead (310k PBKDF2 iterations)
- Steganography: Higher processing time for image operations
- Database queries: Additional indexes minimize performance impact

### Storage Requirements
- Enhanced encryption: ~2x storage for encrypted fields (separate IV, salt, authTag)
- Steganography: Client-side only (IndexedDB), minimal database metadata
- Audit data: Configurable retention periods with automated cleanup

### Migration Strategy
1. Deploy schema updates without breaking existing functionality
2. Implement enhanced encryption as opt-in feature
3. Add steganography support for maximum security users
4. Gradual migration with user education and incentives

## Compliance and Auditing

### Audit Trail Features
- Complete security event logging
- Device trust score tracking
- Risk assessment history
- Security level change monitoring
- Compliance reporting capabilities

### Data Protection
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all new tables
- Encrypted sensitive data at rest
- Minimal exposure of security metadata
- Automated data cleanup and retention

## Conclusion

The database schema changes provide comprehensive support for Zero Trust security implementation while maintaining backward compatibility and performance. The design enables:

- Seamless migration from legacy to enhanced security
- Comprehensive audit trails for compliance
- Continuous verification and risk assessment
- Scalable security analytics and monitoring
- Future extensibility for additional security features

The implementation follows Zero Trust principles of "never trust, always verify" while providing users with choice in their security level based on their needs and risk tolerance.
