# Zero Trust Security Implementation - Maximum (v3) Level

This document describes the implementation of Maximum (v3) level security for the Zero Trust architecture in SignTusk, which combines enhanced encryption with steganography for ultimate wallet protection.

## Overview

The Maximum security level (v3) implements a defense-in-depth approach using:

1. **Enhanced Encryption**: AES-GCM authenticated encryption with strong key derivation
2. **Steganography**: LSB (Least Significant Bit) data hiding within images
3. **Multi-layer Protection**: Combined security measures for maximum protection

## Architecture

### Security Levels

| Level | Version | Description | Features |
|-------|---------|-------------|----------|
| Standard | v1 | Legacy password-based encryption | CryptoJS, PBKDF2, Local storage |
| Enhanced | v2 | Web Crypto API encryption | AES-GCM, 310k iterations, Hardware acceleration |
| Maximum | v3 | Combined encryption + steganography | Enhanced encryption + LSB steganography + Multi-layer protection |

### Storage Architecture

#### Client-Side Storage
- **IndexedDB**: Stores steganography images (large binary data)
- **localStorage**: Stores steganography keys and wallet metadata
- **Memory**: Temporary encryption keys and decrypted data

#### Database Storage
- **Minimal metadata**: Only non-sensitive reference data
- **Security audit trails**: Event logging and risk assessment
- **Device context**: Trust scores and verification history

## Security Features

### Enhanced Encryption (v2/v3)

```typescript
interface EncryptionResult {
  ciphertext: string;  // Base64-encoded encrypted data
  iv: string;          // Base64-encoded initialization vector
  salt: string;        // Base64-encoded salt
  authTag: string;     // Base64-encoded authentication tag
}
```

**Features:**
- AES-GCM authenticated encryption (256-bit keys)
- PBKDF2 key derivation with 310,000 iterations
- Separate encryption for mnemonic and private key
- Hardware acceleration via Web Crypto API
- Integrity protection with authentication tags

### Steganography (v3)

**LSB Technique:**
- Hides data in least significant bits of RGB channels
- Skips alpha channel for better compatibility
- Random padding to prevent statistical analysis
- Deterministic extraction using stego keys

**Storage:**
- Stego images stored in IndexedDB (client-side only)
- Stego keys stored in localStorage (separate from images)
- Minimal metadata in database for audit purposes

### Combined Security (v3)

**Multi-layer Protection:**
1. Enhanced password derivation with additional salt
2. Separate encryption of mnemonic and private key
3. Steganographic hiding of encrypted data
4. Client-side storage with multiple security layers

**Data Flow:**
```
Original Data → Enhanced Encryption → Steganography → Client Storage
                     ↓                    ↓              ↓
              (AES-GCM + PBKDF2)    (LSB + Padding)  (IndexedDB + localStorage)
```

## Usage

### Creating a Maximum Security Wallet

```typescript
import { createSecureWallet } from '@/lib/security-manager';

const walletData = generateWallet();
const password = 'SecurePassword123!';
const carrierImage = new File([...], 'carrier.png', { type: 'image/png' });

await createSecureWallet(walletData, password, {
  level: 'maximum',
  carrierImage: carrierImage // Optional
});
```

### Retrieving a Secure Wallet

```typescript
import { retrieveSecureWallet } from '@/lib/security-manager';

const walletData = await retrieveSecureWallet(address, password);
// Automatically detects and handles all security levels
```

### Security Level Upgrade

```typescript
import { upgradeWalletSecurity } from '@/lib/security-manager';

await upgradeWalletSecurity(
  address, 
  currentPassword, 
  'maximum', 
  carrierImage
);
```

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model

**Protected Against:**

- Statistical analysis (random padding)
- Visual inspection (steganographic hiding)
- Single point of failure (defense in depth)

**Assumptions:**
- Client device is trusted during operation
- Browser security features are intact
- User maintains password security
- Carrier images are not specifically targeted

### Best Practices

1. **Password Security**: Use strong, unique passwords
2. **Carrier Images**: Use diverse, high-quality images
3. **Regular Upgrades**: Keep security levels current
4. **Backup Strategy**: Maintain secure mnemonic backups
5. **Device Security**: Keep browsers and OS updated

## Browser Compatibility
